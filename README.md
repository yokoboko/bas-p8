## About PICO-8

PICO-8 is a fantasy console that encapsulates the essence of the golden age of gaming.

- **Fantasy Console**: PICO-8 is designed as a retro-futuristic fantasy console. It simulates the constraints of hardware from the past, providing a unique creative challenge.

- **Lua Programming**: PICO-8 uses the Lua programming language, making it accessible to both experienced developers and newcomers.

- **Pixel Art**: Embrace the pixel art style with PICO-8's 8x8 pixel sprites. Create charming, nostalgic visuals that hark back to the classic games of the '80s and '90s.

- **Sound and Music**: PICO-8 supports chiptune-style music and sound effects, allowing you to compose catchy retro tunes for your game.

- **Limited Resources**: You have a limited number of tokens (code space), memory, and other resources to work with, just like classic game developers. These constraints spark creativity and problem-solving.
